# Email_Spam_Management_System
The Email Spam Management System is a console-based C++ project designed to simulate the process of identifying and filtering spam emails using basic keyword matching techniques. This project serves as a foundational demonstration of how spam detection logic works in a simplified form, without relying on complex machine learning models.
